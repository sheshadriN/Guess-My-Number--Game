# Guess-My-Number--Game
I have developed a simple game using javascript


.....first
'''dowload and extract the file'''

.... second
'''open vscode'''
'''run the code'''

Game logic
=> Random is created inside the website
=> It will weather the guess num is equal to Random number "you win"
=> otherwise it says that guess number is greater or smaller , at this time score will be decreased.
=> when there is no number entered it shows "No Number Entered"
=> score will be compared to high score and if the score is greater than highscore ,it change the highscore.
